This recipe is about the best way to oven a beef brisket. Brisket, it comes from a cow's breast. It might be one of the least tender cuts beef, but braised, smooked, slowly roasted or ovened, it is rendered soft and satisfying with incredible flavour. 

if you're worried about how fatty the meat is or that it's an unhealty meal, don't worry. Scientist Dr. Stephen Smith discovered high levels of oleic acid in brisket which helps to increase levels of HDL, the good kind of cholesterol. 

Acording to Smith, brisket is the ideal trim for ground beef.
