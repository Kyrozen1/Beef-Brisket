1. Spray inside of a 6-quart slow cooker with cooking spray. Place brisket in slow cooker bowl.
2. Combine seasoning ingredients together and pour over the brisket. Drizzle with oil and rub the seasoning all over the brisket. 
3. Mix sauce ingredients together and completely cover brisket with half of the sauce. Refrigerate remaining sauce to use later.
4. Cover brisket with lid and cook on low setting for 8-10 hours, or high setting for 4-5 hours. 
5. When brisket is tender, transfer onto an oven tray (or baking sheet), lined with parchment paper or foil. 
6. Pour 1/4 cup of juices from the slow cooker bowl into the remaining sauce. Baste brisket with sauce and broil (grill) in preheated oven at 400°F (220°C) for about 10 minutes or until beginning to char and crisp on the edges. Baste again and broil (grill) until sticky and charred on the edges.
7. Rest for 10 minutes to allow the juices to recirculate back into the meat before serving.
8. To serve, slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining barbecue sauce.
